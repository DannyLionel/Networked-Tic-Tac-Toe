On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __5__ based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not accomplish everything stated in the README.md file
4  The program compiles and accomplishes everything stated in the README.md file but is insufficiently documented
5  The program accomplishes everything stated in the README.md and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the code:

The code is very well done, very clean, and well documented. It accounts for all scenarios which I could come up with to prevent the game from not working as intended.
Everything mentioned in the README.md file was met and executed as stated.

The only thing I could possibly suggest is adding a way for the clients to exit the game, or having the client window exit out of the program once the game has ended,
but that is just nitpicking and of course is not necessary.
